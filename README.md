Hi! **python-file-manager** is a file manager (for windows) based on *Python 3.7*. 
With this python based file explorer you can view files, folders and perform actions on them. Actions such as moving them, deleting them (permanently or sending them to recycle bin).

## Modules Used:

1. send2trash
2. os
3. shutil
4. sys

Python 3.7 or above is recommended for using this program.
You need to install *send2trash* module first. You can do this by using the following command:

> pip install send2trash

**send2trash** is a python module that sends files/folders to Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting it.

## Functions you can perform on files/folders

 1. Delete files/folder permanently
 2. Send files/folder to Recycle Bin
 3. Directly open files from the manager
 4. Expand folders
 5. Move files/folders to another location
 6. Copy files/folders to another location
